DotFiles
========

Some of the more important dot files from my homedirectory.
I've removed the dots from the names so that they do not thump any existing files.

I've also split my .bash_profile out into a .bash_profile.d directory. Makes it easier to find things when I want to tweak them.

Running ./install.sh should put all of these files in the right place for you. Of course if you know what you are doing, then you will probably be better off doing this manually.
